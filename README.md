# Stan Templates

[Gelman et. al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf) suggest that Bayesian modelers use templates to save time on model building, computing, and assist in lessening the cognitive load of people that need to understand models.
This repository contains templates from models he built as he learned about modeling data using Stan. 

Examples come from data from his experiments and several textbooks such as [Statistical Rethinking]() and [Regression and Other Stories]().
